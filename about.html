      <h2>Why Accessibility Matters</h2>
      <p>
        Dining out should be an enjoyable experience for everyone, regardless of their physical abilities. Unfortunately, many restaurants still lack basic accessibility features, making it difficult for differently-abled individuals to dine comfortably and independently.

      <p>
